<h3>Outer Banks</h3>
<p>
    Seasons 1-3 on Netflix<br />
    Rating: 5/10<br />
    This show is a good background show. Entertaining but not hard to follow.<br />
</p>

<h3>Dead to Me</h3>
<p>

    This was a great show. Very funny and would watch again.<br />

<h3>Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile</h3>
<p>
    Movie on Netflix<br />
    Rating: 6/10<br />
    This was a good movie with a good plot. It was hard to separate Shawn Mendes' voice from the crocodile, though.
